# pathworks
Gene interaction networks visualization

The link is here : https://ccbr.github.io/pathworks/ 

This is the initial, beta version.
Input is free form human gene names and HTML colors ( https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp ).
If a gene is followed by a color, the gene node is colored with that color.
You can paste a journal paper into the input text box and pathworks will find the gene names.
This is written using vis.js and webassembly. The interactions are from Pathway Commons v13.
